Collection of UI-Features to improve quality of life. Includes an Overlay Bar rework and Itemfilter rework.
Goal is to show certain information or hide unnecessary clutter to improve visual clarity

Improves the responsiveness and usefulness of the item filters available in the game.

### Main Changes

- Overlay Bars and Icons during battle are completely reworked. They can now be colored and scaled.
- Add new customizable option to only show overlay bars on characters which are "damaged"
- New missing armor indicator in the formation screen to quickly see who needs a new armor
- Customizable thresholds for the missing health/armor indicator
- Mood Icon in Town/World Screen that either shows lowest mood or average mood of your company
- Removes the delay when clicking an item filter
- New option to hide all empty item slots
- Item Filter also apply to the shop
- Hotkeys for switching between Item Filters (1-5)
- New third highlight options for blocked tiles with a unique higlight for objects blocking visibility

### Minor Changes

- Removes the mini helmet, -chest and -health icons on the bars during battle
- Moved Shields from the Armor-Filter over to the Weapon-Filter
- Active filter now have a slight green border
- Adds Support for a warning Icon in Town/World or Formation Screen that can be spawned by other mods.
- The last chosen higlighting option for blocked tiles is now remembered throughout the whole playthrough

### Requirements ###

- Modding Script Hooks
- Modding Standards and Utilities (MSU)

### Compatibility

- Should be safe to remove from- and add to any existing savegames
- UI Mods that cover similar features will likely have conflicts with this mod
- Legends and EIMO work fine with this mod

### Known Issues: ###

- Necrosavants teleporting inside bushes become invisible, including their Overlay. Not 100% if this is this mods fault. But if then Its probably because of the fadeToStoredColors overwrite
- The vanilla behavior of the bars might not be fully emulated. I'm open for any detail that I missed. (except the missing helmet/armor/health Icon. They are gone on purpose)
- The overlay bars of enemies with specific animations like with teleporting abilties will briefly lose their color and turn white before they turn back to the chosen color. I don't know a better solution than fight the symptoms.
- The Overlay vanishes instantly instead of fading out after an actor was damaged (as opposed to vanilla behavior). Don't think this is worth the effort of fixing.

### Future Plans: ###

- Implement the vanilla feature of highlighting the portion of life that was just lost
- Remember itemfilter for differen shops
- add a forceDisplayOverlay call when new Icons/Effects were applied to a character (e.g. negative on allies and positive on enemies)
- Analyse/Split up the Mini-Icons. Overlay could react to changing buffs/debuffs/dots. Or only display certain types while hiding others
- Indicator for when the Weapon/Shield are at lower durability. Though it is getting tight, trying to fit in more symbols down there
- Cleaner way of getting the filter information from squirrel to javascript
- Save information about last filter between savegames
- Display the spaceUsed and spaceMax depending on the current filter setting
